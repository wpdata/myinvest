# Specification Quality Checklist: MyInvest v0.1 - Intelligent Investment Analysis System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS

All checks passed:
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (import records, receive recommendations, execute trades, view market data) rather than HOW to implement
- No mention of specific technologies in requirements (Python, Google ADK, SQLite mentioned only in Dependencies/Constraints sections, not in functional requirements)
- Written in business language understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS

All checks passed:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-038) are testable with clear expected behaviors
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-011) include specific metrics:
  - Time metrics: "within 30 seconds", "in under 3 seconds", "under 3 clicks and 2 minutes"
  - Percentage metrics: "100% of recommendations", "100% of operations"
  - Boolean metrics: "correctly displays", "successfully rejects"
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can complete workflow" not "React component renders")
- All user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases section covers 6 common boundary conditions
- Scope clearly bounded with "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" sections
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections clearly documented

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS

All checks passed:
- Each functional requirement maps to measurable success criteria or quality gates
- Four user stories (P1-P4) cover all primary user flows:
  - P1: Data foundation (import and view)
  - P2: Intelligence layer (recommendations)
  - P3: Action layer (execution)
  - P4: Analysis layer (market data)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes ("Users can import", "System generates", "System rejects") not implementation details
- No implementation leakage detected (all technical details properly contained in Dependencies/Constraints)

## Investment Safety Validation

Additional validation for investment-specific requirements:

- [x] All recommendations must include stop-loss (FR-017, SC-006)
- [x] Max loss amount prominently displayed (FR-022, QG-001)
- [x] Position limits validated (FR-023, FR-024, SC-007)
- [x] Explicit user confirmation required (FR-026, FR-027)
- [x] Simulation mode clearly indicated (FR-029)
- [x] Operation logging comprehensive (FR-030, FR-031, FR-032)
- [x] Data integrity and traceability (FR-003, FR-004, FR-008, FR-009)

All investment safety requirements properly specified and testable.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed from user
- All mandatory safety requirements for investment system included
- Scope appropriately limited for v0.1 MVP with clear deferral to v0.2 for advanced features
- Quality gates (QG-001 through QG-005) provide clear validation criteria for implementation phase

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION APPROVED - Ready for planning phase
